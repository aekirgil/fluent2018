8-grid-intro Instructions

Jen will talk about Grid via the Powerpoint slides to get started.

She will show some reordering of Grid with reordering.html and reordering.css.

Use the file Grid Properties.txt as a reference through the day. Parent and child grid properties are identified, along with common values. 

***Not all Grid properties will be covered.*** However, by the end of the workshop, you should have enough working knowledge to pick up on anything not covered here today.
